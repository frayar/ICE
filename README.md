ICE: Image Collections Explorer
================================

ICE is an interactive exploration platform to visualise large image collections. 
The image collection has been structured in a hierarchical and graph-based hybrid structure.


ICE has been developed during my PhD, entitled *Interactive, incremental and multi-level exploration of large collections of images*.
This PhD has been defended in November the 22nd, 2016 in the University Fran√ßois-Rabelais of Tours.


ICE can be tested online in my homepage: [http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/ice/](http://frederic.rayar.free.fr/ice/)
The collection presented as demonstration is the Wang data set, that is composed of 1000 images.


ICE has been developed with web technologies, namely HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
Third-party librairies are AngularJS, Linkurious.js
